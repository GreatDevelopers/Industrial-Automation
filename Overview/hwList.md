## [ES5152](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/el5xxx-position-measurement/el5152.html)

ES5152 is an EtherCAT Terminal Card Encoder, 2-channel encoder interface, incremental, 24 V DC HTL, 100 kHz

An interface for the direct connection of two incremental encoders (24-V-HTL) with A and B track. EL5152 can be used as a up/down counter.

It enables the measurement of a period or frequency with a resolution of 100 ns. With the optional interpolating microincrement functionality

## [ES1008](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/el1xxx-digital-input/el1008.html)

ES1008 is an EtherCAT Terminal, 8-channel digital input, 24 V DC, 3 ms

Acquires the binary 24 V control signals from the process level and transmits them, in an electrically isolated form, to the higher-level automation unit. Type 1/3

## [EL2809](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/el2xxx-digital-output/el2809.html)

EL2809 is an EtherCAT Terminal, 16-channel digital output, 24 V DC, 0.5 A

This digital output terminal connects the binary 24 V DC control signals from the automation device on to the actuators at the process level with electrical isolation.

Connection of different load types possible (ohmic, inductive, lamp load)
Max. output current 0.5 A per channel
Tool-free connection by direct plug-in technology for solid wire conductors
Direct connection of multi-channel actuators in 1-wire connection technology.

## [EL6002](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/el6xxx-communication/el6002.html)

EL6002 is an EtherCAT Terminal, 2-channel communication interface, serial, RS232, D-sub

This serial interface enables the connection of devices with two RS232 interfaces. The devices connected to the EL6002 EtherCAT Terminal communicate with the automation device via the Coupler. The active communication channel operates independently of the higher-level EtherCAT system in full duplex mode with 300 baud up to 115.2 kbaud. The RS232 interfaces guarantee high interference immunity through electrically isolated signals.

In conjunction with the TwinCAT Virtual Serial COM Driver, the EL6002 can be used as a normal Windows COM interface.

## [EL9011](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/el9xxx-system/el9011.html)

EL9011 is bus end cover for E-bus contacts

Each bus station must be terminated on the right-hand side with an end cap. The EL9011 covers the E-bus contacts and is color-matched to the EL terminal series.


## [EK1100](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/i-o/ethercat-terminals/ek1xxx-bk1xx0-ethercat-coupler/ek1100.html)

The EK1100 EtherCAT Coupler is the link between the EtherCAT protocol at fieldbus level and the EtherCAT Terminals. The coupler converts the passing telegrams from Ethernet 100BASE-TX to E-bus signal representation. A station consists of a coupler and any number of EtherCAT Terminals that are automatically detected and individually displayed in the process image.

1. 2 x RJ45 socket, 
1. Connection lengths: up to 100 m
1. Number of EtherCAT Terminals in the overall system: up to 65,535

The EK1100 has two RJ45 sockets. The upper Ethernet interface is used to connect the coupler to the network; the lower socket serves for the optional connection of further EtherCAT devices in the same segment. In addition, an EtherCAT junction or an EtherCAT extension can be used for the extension or for setting up a line or star topology.

The EK9000 and EK1000 couplers are suitable for use at the switch.
